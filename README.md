This code findes the center points of a corner points structures in the
3D space. The algorithm of this code is as below:
Step 1: Extracting the top and bottom coordinate of pillars and finding
the pillar lines equation.
Step 2: Extracting the Z-coordinates of grid corners and finding the X 
and Y-coordinate of these points using the equations and Z-coordinate.
Step 3: Finding the center points of top and bottom face of each cell
by intersecting the digonal lines.
Step 4: Finding the cell center using arithmetic average of two last
points.
